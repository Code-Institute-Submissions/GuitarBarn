## Testing 

Used the following online tool to test the project functionality:

- [Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) - to validate HTML

- [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - to validate CSS

- [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/) - to validate Python code

- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) - to validate JavaScript/jQuery


I have also conducted additional tests using **Python Testing** to check for possible errors and issues.

- step by step procedure:
    - activated virtual environment

    - used the **python3 manage.py** command to start testing

#### To run the tests within a specific app only it needs to be specified using the command below:

- python3 manage.py test + name ogf the app 


### Additional testing

Asked my friends to test the website on different devices to check its responsiveness.
